# react-timesheet

Drag and drop your monthly CSV time sheet data into this react app to display a 
formatted time sheet to be printed out and signed by your customer.

Intended for freelancers like me who keep track of their project hours using an app such as 
[Time Recording Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dynamicg.timerecording.pro).

Sadly, it's currently only available in German.
